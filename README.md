# web-worker-sample

Simple sample of web worker


## How to run

Just `npm install` and run `grunt` on terminal. After this, just visit [localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001).

**But...** You need a https server to run workers. So, I recommend you install [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.io/) that provides a tunnel for applications. He serves on https too.

After install ngrok, just type `ngrok http 9001` on application folder, and visit the https link that is demonstrated on terminal.
